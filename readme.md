# Dotfiles

Install using the following scripts in bin/
* install - installs brew and stow, and stows my dotfiles
* brews - installs development environment including terminal apps/cmd line utilities
* casks - installs osx gui apps traditionally installed with dmgs
* osx-settings.sh - script to set my osx prefs

The basic structure and initial incarnation of these dotfiles was shamelessly stolen from a former coworker, Mark Borcherding:
